# 100 Days of SQL
We all know that one of the main requirement in Data Engineering is good knowledge of SQL. So I thought of learning SQL in starting from beginner level to advanced level. I drew a learning map and finally decided to learn on 100days of SQL. During this 100 days, I would be learning SQL for 1.5 hour daily and noted down what I learnt for that day.
